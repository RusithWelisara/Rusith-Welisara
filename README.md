# Rusith Welisara

AI systems builder focused on robotics, autonomous systems, and offline-first artificial intelligence.

I design and build practical systems that combine software intelligence with real-world interaction — including voice-driven assistants, computer vision pipelines, hardware control, and automation.

## Focus Areas
- Offline AI assistants (LLMs, speech, vision, control logic)
- Robotics & autonomous systems (Arduino, sensors, actuators)
- Computer vision (real-time detection, gestures, tracking)
- Automation and system orchestration

---

## Core Technologies
- Python, JavaScript
- Arduino, ESP32
- OpenCV, YOLO
- Local LLMs, speech-to-text, text-to-speech

---

## Selected Projects
- **Offline AI Assistant** — voice + vision based assistant designed to run without cloud dependency  
- **Computer Vision Systems** — real-time object detection and gesture control pipelines  
- **Robotics Automation** — hardware-integrated control systems using microcontrollers  

(See pinned repositories for detailed implementations.)

## Philosophy
I prioritize systems that work in the real world over demos, tutorials, or throwaway experiments.  
Clarity, robustness, and integration matter more than hype.
